# Getting and Cleaning Data

### Course Project (Due August 28, 2016)

The objective of this assignment is to create an R script called run_analysis.R that completes the following tasks:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names; and,
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

### To run the script, begin by completing these tasks:

1. Download the zip file from [this URL](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip);
2. Unzip the file;
3. Move the following files to the same working directory as the R script:
	* `features.txt`
	* `subject_train.txt`
	* `subject_test.txt`
	* `X_train.txt`
	* `X_test.txt`
	* `y_train.txt`
	* `y_test.txt`
4. Execute run_analysis.R
